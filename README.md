# Super-Smash-Pikachu

One of my most time-consuming projects - this was my final assignment submission for Grade 12 Computer Science. To the naked eye it seems pretty basic but there's a lot going on in the background, and there is a simulated 3D rotation effect built into the camera system despite using a 2D SFML graphics API.

(careful for the volume however)

All animation images are mine but the music is from somewhere I can't remember
